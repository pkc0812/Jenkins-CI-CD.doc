“Jenkins is reserved for jobs with matching label expressions. myfreestyle is offline.”

This usually means Jenkins can't find an available agent (node) that matches the job's label requirements. Here's how you can troubleshoot it step by step:

🛠️ Fixing the “Offline / Pending” Jenkins Job Issue
1. Check Job Configuration
Go to Configure for the "myfreestyle" job.

Look for the “Restrict where this project can be run” option.

If it's checked, make sure the label matches an active agent/node label.

2. Verify Agent Status
Go to Manage Jenkins → Nodes.

Check if the agent/node is:

Online

Connected

Has the correct label assigned

If the node is offline or disconnected, Jenkins won’t be able to run the job.

3. Check Master/Controller Availability
If you're running Jenkins on a single machine (no agents), make sure the job isn’t restricted to a label that doesn’t exist.

Uncheck “Restrict where this project can be run” to allow it to run on the master.

4. Review Jenkins Logs
Go to Manage Jenkins → System Log.

Look for any errors related to node connection, label mismatch, or job scheduling.

5. Restart Jenkins
Sometimes a simple restart can reinitialize the agent connections and clear pending jobs.

✅ Quick Test
Try creating a new freestyle job without any label restrictions and run it. If that works, the issue is definitely label-related.

Thanks for sharing that, Pavan — the issue is crystal clear now. Your Jenkins job is restricted to run on an agent labeled plc-0812, but Jenkins is warning:

"No agent/cloud matches this label expression. Did you mean '5' instead of 'plc-0812'?"

That means Jenkins can't find any active node with the label plc-0812, so the job just sits in the Pending state.

✅ Here's how to fix it:
1. Double-check the label spelling
Go to Manage Jenkins → Nodes.

Click on the node you expect to run the job.

Make sure its label is exactly plc-0812. Even a small typo or case mismatch will break it.

2. Assign the correct label to your agent
If the node exists but has a different label (like 5), you can:

Either change the job’s label to match the node (5)

Or edit the node configuration and set its label to plc-0812

3. Remove label restriction (if not needed)
If you don’t need to restrict the job to a specific agent:

Uncheck “Restrict where this project can be run” in the job config.

This will allow Jenkins to run the job on any available node (including master, if enabled).

4. Verify agent is online
Even if the label matches, the node must be connected and online.

If it’s offline, Jenkins won’t schedule the job there.


🛠️ Steps to Mount a Drive via /etc/fstab
1. Identify the Device or Share
Use lsblk or blkid to find the device name or UUID:

bash
lsblk
blkid

2. Create a Mount Point
Choose a directory Jenkins can access, like /mnt/jenkins_data:

bash
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/jenkins_data
3. Edit /etc/fstab
Open the file with root privileges:

bash
sudo nano /etc/fstab
Add a line like this (for a local disk):

bash
UUID=your-uuid-here /mnt/jenkins_data ext4 defaults 0 2
Or for a network share (e.g. SMB):

bash
//192.168.1.100/share /mnt/jenkins_data cifs credentials=/etc/smb-credentials,iocharset=utf8,sec=ntlm 0 0
🔐 If using credentials, create /etc/smb-credentials with:🧪 What You Might Try Next
If you want to go further:

Code
username=your_user
password=your_pass
Then secure it:

bash
sudo chmod 600 /etc/smb-credentials
4. Test the Mount
Before rebooting, test with:

bash
sudo mount -a
If no errors appear, you're good to go.

🧪 What You Might Try Next
If you want to go further:

Mount a dedicated tmpfs for Jenkins workspace:sudo mkdir /mnt/jenkins_tmp
echo "tmpfs /mnt/jenkins_tmp tmpfs defaults,size=2G 0 0" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab                             > mount the disk to jenkins
sudo mount -a
